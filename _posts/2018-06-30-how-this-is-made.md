## How this is made
__Recycle your breadcrumbs :recycle::bread:__

This site was started on a late night browsing streak, with a motivation: to Keep stuff simple.  
Before tackling new projects, I usually spend time documenting myself, hoarding tabs as I plow through docs and community content.  

On many occurrences, this ended unfortunately.

After an hour or two down the rabbit hole, I'd have a good mental representation of the task at hand but lost focus. This faced me with an uncomfortable choice:  
- Painfully get through boilerplate tasks hoping I'd get back into _the zone_.  
Distracting videos and other forms of procrastination usually get the best of me then, and that would ruin all previous effort.
- Sleep on it hoping I'd get back at it... Whenever.

Taking notes as I went was one obvious way to palliate, and that would usually be the [`README.md`][home] of my projects.
