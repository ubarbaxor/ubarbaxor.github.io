## How this is made
__Recycle your breadcrumbs with Jekyll ‚ôªÔ∏èüçû__

This site was started on a late night browsing streak, with a motivation: to Keep stuff simple.  
Before tackling new projects, I usually spend time documenting myself, hoarding tabs as I plow through docs and community content.  

On many occurrences, this ended unfortunately.

After an hour or two down the rabbit hole, I'd have a good mental representation of the task at hand but lost focus. This faced me with an uncomfortable choice:  
- Sleep on it hoping I'd get back at it... Whenever.
- Painfully get through boilerplate tasks hoping I'd get back into _the zone_.

Distracting videos and other forms of procrastination or even plain loss of interest for the project would eventually get the best of me then, and ruin previously accumulated effort.

Taking notes as I went was one obvious way to palliate, and that would usually end in some Markdown [`README.md`][project home] in my projects. Since [GitHub](https://github.com/) renders it by default, that's also a frictionless way to communicate on a project's status. In extension to this, they even provide [a free hosting service][gh-pages] bundled with sub-domain referencing under [github.io][gh-pages], which is also super simple: anyone with [a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) may create a repository named under the format `username.github.io`. After a few minutes, it'll be available at that URL.

After making that repo for myself and populating it with a README.md file, I left it to rest for a while. On my return, I was happy to find https://ubarbaxor.github.io online. I was even surprised to see my README.md nicely served, with a theme and everything, as a homepage.

[project home]: https://github.com/ubarbaxor/ubarbaxor.github.io
[gh-pages]: https://pages.github.com/
