## The Blog
__Blogging made lazy__

I've picked up the habit of writing `.md` files as I go, be it for taking notes or establishing to-do lists.  
[Markdown][wikipedia] is a _clear text syntax_, meaning files in that format remain human-readable when opened without specialized software. It is also widely spread in the tech world, and hence integrated with many tools and platforms.  
Atom, for instance, has [a Markdown Preview addon][Markdown Preview], and GitHub [renders it by default][gh.io]. This also means [programmatic packages][npm] for any custom needs.

Ease of creation & publication encouraged the idea that if some of my notes could be of public use, I should try and publish a few articles and resources here.

I could have slapped some Markdown down a `/blog` somewhere and served it, but stumbling upon some stuff called [_Jekyll Now_][jekyllnow.com], I decided to give it a go. From [what I've read][Jekyll Home], Jekyll is a static template renderer that accepts, among other things... Markdown. Also, that's working pretty well with [GitHub's free hosting solution][gh-pages]. The _Jekyll Now_ project aims to provide a preset Jekyll blog in virtually no time.

With this introduction, I had enough material to give instant blogging a try, and a subject for [a first article][article 0].
