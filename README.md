## The Blog

I've picked up the habit of writing `.md` files as I go, be it for taking notes or establishing to-do lists.  
[Markdown][wikipedia] is a _clear text syntax_, meaning files in that format remain human-readable when opened without specialized software. It is also widely spread in the tech world, and hence integrated with many tools and platforms.  
Atom, for instance, has [a Markdown Preview addon][Markdown Preview], and GitHub [renders it by default][gh.io]. This also means [programmatic packages][npm] for any custom needs.

This tickled the lazy in me with an idea - maybe some of my notes may be of public use. I may try and publish a few articles and resources here.
